<h1><strong>About</strong></h1>

This is the repository for the new Heinz Chapel Choir website, meant to replace the current site located at www.pitt.edu/~heinzcc.
The current site was created in 1999 and had been barely updated structurally since its inception. This project is meant to bring
the Heinz Chapel Choir's web presence into the 21st century.

<h1><strong>Authors</strong></h1>
The authors of this project are Joseph Rogers and Benjamin Muscato, current members of the Heinz Chapel Choir at the University of
Pittsburgh and Computer Science undergraduate students.

<h1><strong>Launch Goal</strong></h1>
This site has an internal launch deadline of April 2016. The currently requested domain for the new site is hcc.pitt.edu.
